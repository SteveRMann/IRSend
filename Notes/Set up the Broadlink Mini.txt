Set up the Broadlink Mini

1) Press Reset until the blue LED is flashing quickly.
2) Open the IHC App on the phone
3) Click on + then Add Device.
4) Select "Universal Remote"
5) Select RM Mini 3.
   The App will scan for new devices.
6) When found, you can select the Network credentials.
7) After a few seconds, the LED stops the fast blink
   You can give the remote a name now.
8) Use an IP scanner to find the IP of the Broadlink device.
   Hint: Sort on the manufacturer and search for "HangZhou Gubei Electronics Technology Co.,Ltd"
9) In the router- make the IP Static, because the IP is hard coded in Home Assistant.
10) You can close the IHC app on the phone.
11) Save the IP address and MAC address - you will need them in Home Assistant.

Open switches.yaml

The section for the Broadlink devices should look like this:

# Family Room Broadlink
  - platform: broadlink
    friendly_name: Family Room
    host: 192.168.1.53
    mac: '78:0F:77:5A:E3:F0'
    type: rm2_pro_plus
    switches: !include broadlink_Family_Room.yaml

# Office Broadlink.
  - platform: broadlink
    friendly_name: Office
    host: 192.168.1.40
    mac: '78:0F:77:48:30:DE'
    type: rm2_pro_plus
    switches: !include broadlink_Office.yaml
	
* Save switches.yaml, check the config then restart Home Assistant.
* In <> (States), find a convenient switch to test the Broadlink.
:    I use "switch.kenmorefan_family_room_power" or "switch.kenmorefan_office_power" because I can test
:	both Broadlnks in the office.
* In Services, enter one of the Broadlink switch entity names into the Services page.
:    The service to call is switch.turn.on
* Click on "Call Service" and the fan should turn on or off.  (On and off are the same code).
